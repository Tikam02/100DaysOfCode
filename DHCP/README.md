<h1>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) </h1>
<hr>
<p>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address to any device, or node, on a network so they can communicate using IP. DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations rather than requiring network administrators to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. DHCP can be implemented on small local networks as well as large enterprise networks.</p>
<br>
<p>DHCP will assign new IP addresses in each location when devices are moved from place to place, which means network administrators do not have to manually initially configure each device with a valid IP address or reconfigure the device with a new IP address if it moves to a new location on the network. Versions of DHCP are available for use in Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).</p>
